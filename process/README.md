# "I shoot"

This is the process documentation wiki for the game _"I shoot"_. The process documentation available here is the result of following the [MDMA](http://www.gamesasresearch.com/mdma) (Method for Design Materialisation and Analysis), an approach to game design recoverability that forms the basis of the [Games as Research](http://www.gamesasresearch.com/) project I am part of with [Rilla Khaled](http://www.rillakhaled.com/) and [Jonathan Lessard](https://jonathanlessard.net/).

### [Task List](./Task-List.md)
The todo list of practical tasks for the project.

### [Process Journal](./Process-Journal.md)
A journal that includes high-level reflections on the design and development process, intended to be complementary to the [commit history of the repository](https://github.com/pippinbarr/untitled-voice-shooter/commits/master).

### [Research Statement](./Research-Statement.md)
A series of attempts to crystallise the meaning and intent of the game.
