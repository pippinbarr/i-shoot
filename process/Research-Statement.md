# Research Statement v1.0 / Tuesday, 14 August 2018, 11:17AM

- This is a game about videogame violence.
- It is a way for me to explore and export my discomfort with videogame violence.
- It is intended to foreground how creepy and upsetting are the things we routinely do in videogames.
- This foregrounding will be achieved by requiring the player to _speak_ their actions in the world of the game as well as their immediate consequences.
- The _hypothesis_ is that __speaking violent acts and consequences in the first person will be more affecting and upsetting than performing those same actions with keyboard and mouse__.
- The gameplay will take place in a branching narrative structure, a hypertext with a spoken interface.
- The objective of the writing will be to be neutral and factual.
- The game will use Counter-Strike (Global Offensive) and its map de_dust2 as the grounding of the experience and actions in order to tie this new structure to a 'realistic' and common form of experience of videogame violence
- It is a spiritual sequel to _A Series of Gunshots_ with important differences.

# Research Statement v2.0 / Monday, 20 August 2018, 11:04AM

- "I point and shoot" is a game about enacting videogame violence
- It involves the translation of a first-person shooter experience to a hypertext environment in which actions (links) are taken via voice commands
- It leverages the framework of _Counter-Strike: Global Offensive_ and the specific map de_dust2 as a way to ensure it depicts "authentic" videogame violence
- The game is intended to ask the question (of the player) of whether the violence already commonly enacted in violent videogames (like CS:GO) registers more deeply when you are asked to speak rather than point-and-click your way through the world
- The hypothesis, such as it is, is that __speaking violent actions will make the violent nature of the actions more inescapably salient to the player and (in my dreams) lead them to question violent videogame actions more generally__
- To support this question/hypothesis, the objective will be to focus on a neutral writing approach to avoid colouring or suggesting reactions/valences to the player
- To support the parallels to the reference game (CS:GO) I will attempt to bring the textual version sufficiently close to it (random encounters with enemies, ability to move through space, chance of being killed yourself, etc.) that the potential issue of the textual version simply being too dissimilar to draw a fair comparison is at least partly addressed
- THe game is a spiritual successor to _A Series of Gunshots_, coming from a new angle

# Research Statement v3.0 / Friday, 16 November 2018, 7:08AM

- _"I shoot"_ exists to test a different representation of conventional videogame violence
- The objective is to have violent actions "land" affectively rather than be abstracted into game-think
- The form has two key elements
- First, the game is played with the voice, with the idea that speaking violent actions is less susceptible to dismissal as just play (perhaps for novelty reasons, but perhaps also with the idea that speaking the actions takes ownership and genuinely enacts the first person)
- Second, the game is a translation of _Counter-Strike: Global Offensive_'s de_dust2 map into a text adventure, with the idea (similar to _A Series of Gunshots_) of reducing visual, auditory, interface, etc. reward structures in favour of a (deeply flawed of course) "neutrality"
- Thus, the game is intended to create the "opportunity" to perform violent actions with the voice and, ideally, to have those actions register with more emotional agency than point-and-click shooting
